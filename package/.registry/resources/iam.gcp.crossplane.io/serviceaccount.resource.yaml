overview: |
 A service account is a special kind of account used by an application or a virtual machine (VM) instance, not a person. Applications use service accounts to make authorized API calls.
 For example, a Compute Engine VM may run as a service account, and that account can be given permissions to access the resources it needs. This way the service account is the identity of the service, and the service account's permissions control which resources the service can access.
 A service account is identified by its email address, which is unique to the account.

 ## User-managed Service Accounts
 
 You can create user-managed service accounts in your project using the IAM API, the Cloud Console, or the gcloud command-line tool. You are responsible for managing and securing these accounts.

 By default, you can create up to 100 user-managed service accounts in a project. If this quota does not meet your needs, you can use the Cloud Console to request a quota increase. The default service accounts described on this page do not count towards this quota.

 When you create a user-managed service account in your project, you choose a name for the service account. This name appears in the email address that identifies the service account.

 ## Default Service Accounts

 When you use some Google Cloud services, they create user-managed service accounts that enable the service to deploy jobs that access other Google Cloud resources. These accounts are known as default service accounts.

 The default service accounts help you get started with Google Cloud services. For production workloads, we strongly recommend that you create your own user-managed service accounts and grant the appropriate roles to each service account.

 When a default service account is created, it is automatically granted the Editor role (roles/editor) on your project. This role includes a very large number of permissions. To follow the principle of least privilege, we strongly recommend that you disable the automatic role grant by adding a constraint to your organization policy, or by revoking the Editor role manually. If you disable or revoke the role grant, you must decide which roles to grant to the default service accounts.

 ## Google-managed Service Accounts

 In addition to your user-managed service accounts and default service accounts, you might see other service accounts in your project's IAM policy or in the Cloud Console. These service accounts are created and managed by Google, and they are used by Google services.
